# Mapping Earthquakes
Project using Javascript, CSS, and HTML to format and display data for earthquakes on a map.

### Resources
- Data source: [PB2002_boundaries.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json), [USGS Earthquake GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson)
- Tools: Javascript, HTML, CSS, VSCode, Leaflet, Mapbox

## Overview of Project
My clients Basil and Sadhana asked me to create an earthquake map with multiple tile layers (map styles) and overlays (marked data). The magnitude of earthquakes determines the circle marker size and color. The map overlays can be toggled on and off and users can choose between 3 different map styles. There is a legend to make it easier for users to determine earthquake magnitude based on the markers.

## Summary
In the future a z-offset for the overlays could be added for more clarity when viewing the map, with major earthquakes as the bottom and tectonic plates as the top.
